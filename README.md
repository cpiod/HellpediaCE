# HellpediaCE (Community Edition)

**This mod contains a lot of spoilers for Jupiter Hell!**

This Jupiter Hell mod replaces the "help" section with some cheatsheets on:
- the branches in Callisto, Europa and Io, their mechanisms, their perks and rewards
- the paths in the Purgatory to get the uniques
- the three Dark Cathedral wishes
- the perks you can get from mod packs through Whizkid

You can access HellpediaCE from the main menu and the in-game menu. The mod will only work if you use the English language!

## How to install

Extract the "data" folder from the archive and place it directly into your Jupiter Hell root directory. Make no sub-folder nor rename any of the folder or files.
