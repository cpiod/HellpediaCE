# HellpediaCE (Community Edition)

**This mod contains a lot of spoilers for [Jupiter Hell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/811320/Jupiter_Hell/)!**

This Jupiter Hell mod replaces the "help" section with some cheatsheets on:
- the branches in Callisto, Europa, Io and Dante, their mechanisms, their perks and rewards
- the perks you can get from mod packs through Whizkid
- the descriptions of all unique and exotics weapons
- the paths to uniques in the Purgatory

You can access HellpediaCE from the main menu and the in-game menu.

## How to install

Create a "mods" folder in the Jupiter Hell root directory if it does not exist. Then, extract the "hellpediaCE" directory inside this "mods" folder. Make no sub-folder nor rename any of the folder or files.

If you are on MacOS: navigate to your Jupiter Hell app, right click, select "show package contents". Then navigate to contents, MacOS, create a "mods" folder and copy the "hellpediaCE" folder there.
