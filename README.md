# HellpediaCE (Community Edition)

**This mod contains a lot of spoilers for Jupiter Hell!**

This Jupiter Hell mod replaces the "help" section with some cheatsheets on:
- the branches in Callisto, Europa, Io and Dante, their mechanisms, their perks and rewards
- the three Dark Cathedral wishes
- the perks you can get from mod packs through Whizkid
- the descriptions of all unique weapons

You can access HellpediaCE from the main menu and the in-game menu. The mod will only work if you use the English language!

## How to install

Extract the "data" folder from the archive and place it directly into your Jupiter Hell root directory. Make no sub-folder nor rename any of the folder or files.

If you are on MacOS: navigate to your Jupiter Hell app, right click, select "show package contents". Then navigate to contents, MacOS, and copy the data folder there.
