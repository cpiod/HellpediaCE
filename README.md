!HellpediaCE (Community Edition)

This Jupiter Hell mod replaces the "help" section with some cheatsheets on:
- the branches in the moons, their mechanisms, their perks and rewards
- the paths in the Purgatory to get the uniques
- the three Cathedral wishes
- the perk obtainable from mod packs through Whizkid

You can access HellpediaCE from the main menu and from the in-game menu.

!! How to install

Extract the "data" folder from the archive and place it directly into your Jupiter Hell root directory. Make no sub-folder nor rename any of the folder or files.
